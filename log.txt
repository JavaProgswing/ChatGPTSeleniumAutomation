* Choose from one of these MCQ Options: 1) Produce the final product,2) Identify the most cost-effective design,3) Verify the performance of the design against requirements,4) Market the design to potential clients
Response: There are two main types of scalability:.Vertical Scalability (Scaling Up): Involves adding more resources (such as CPU, RAM, or storage) to a single server or machine to improve its performance. It is typically limited by the capacity of the hardware..Horizontal Scalability (Scaling Out): Involves adding more machines or instances to a system, distributing the workload across multiple servers to improve performance and capacity. This approach can often handle larger volumes and offers more flexibility..Scalability is crucial for systems that need to grow over time and should be a key consideration during system architecture and design. It ensures the system can meet future demands while maintaining efficiency and responsiveness.
